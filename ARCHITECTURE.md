# SUPAA System Architecture

## Overview
SUPAA is an agentic platform powered by specialized, fine-tuned AI models. Our current focus is the **English-Japanese AI Tutor**, a demonstration of pedagogical excellence through model specialization.

## Core Components
1.  **Gemma4-4b Base Model:** Our foundational LLM, chosen for its high performance at a small scale (4B parameters), native tool-use, and reasoning capabilities.
2.  **Specialized Adapters (LoRA):** We apply Low-Rank Adaptation to specialize the base model for specific domains (e.g., EN-JP Teaching).
3.  **Orchestration Layer (Paperclip):** Manages multiple agents (CTO, Lead ML Engineer, UX Designer, etc.) to execute complex workflows.
4.  **Web MVP:** A React-based interface for user interaction, showcasing real-time reasoning and pedagogical feedback.

## Web Application Architecture (MVP)

The SUPAA MVP uses a decoupled architecture to ensure scalability and high performance for real-time agentic interactions.

### 1. Backend (Express/Node.js)
- **Role:** Orchestration layer and API gateway.
- **Key Features:**
    - Real-time streaming of model responses and "Internal Monologue" (Reasoning).
    - Session management for persistent tutor interactions.
    - Integration with the Gemma4 API for model inference.
- **Stack:** Node.js, Express.

### 2. Frontend (React)
- **Role:** Interactive user interface for language learning.
- **Key Features:**
    - Dynamic chat interface with pedagogical reasoning sidebars.
    - Interactive grammar highlighting and real-time feedback toasts.
    - Adherence to the **Nova Design System** for foundations (colors, typography).
- **Stack:** React (TypeScript), Vite, Vanilla CSS.

### 3. Communication
- **Protocol:** HTTP Streaming / WebSockets for low-latency updates of the reasoning map and chat bubbles.


## Data Flow
1.  **User Input:** Captured via the Web MVP.
2.  **Inference:** Handled by a fine-tuned Gemma4 model served via vLLM on GCP.
3.  **Reasoning Extraction:** The model's internal monologue is captured via `<thought>` tags or the `reasoning` field and streamed to the UI.
4.  **Tool Execution:** When needed, the model calls tools (e.g., dictionary lookups, grammar validation) which are executed by the Paperclip adapter.

## Model Specialization Pipeline
1.  **Data Generation:** High-quality synthetic pedagogical data generated via Gemini 2.5 Pro.
2.  **Fine-tuning:** PEFT/LoRA training using Unsloth on GCP L4 GPUs.
3.  **Evaluation:** Benchmarking against the base model for domain-specific accuracy and nuance.
4.  **Deployment:** Serving the fine-tuned adapter via vLLM.
